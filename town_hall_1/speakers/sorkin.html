	<h3>Movie Reviews</h3>
		<blockquote> "Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across
		as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities
		of the players rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what
		really happened. Even that would not have been so bad but the 
		movie tries to portray lots of these folks as sympatheric figures
		just trying to do the right thing" </blockquote>
		<blockquote>
		"I am watching this for the 3rd time, trying to understand how this
		large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw thier families,
		descendants, neighbours, countrymen and the rest of the whole world
		with absolutely no compassion"
